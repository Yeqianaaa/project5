                <h1>Living In a Different World</h1>
                <h2>by Yeqian Li</h6>
                <p>This time I made an installation about the COCID-19 pandemic in China. I present several small scenes from the epidemic through some composite materials, including three-dimensional books, clay, and fabric, to show the epidemic's impact on life of Chinese people.
                    Because China's control over the COVID-19 epidemic is much stricter than that of other countries, the Chinese people have had different experiences in the epidemic from their previous lives. Due to its uniqueness and enormous impact, I have decided to express it in artistic form to commemorate this special time.
                    In fact, I prefer to present it as an small art exhibition.Through various small-scale installations, I hope to showcase the entire process of the epidemic. These works are presented from the general public's perspective and can resonate with the audience. It's exactly what we've experienced.
                    The epidemic has permeated the youth of our generation of Chinese people, so I want to bring this epidemic to life through my art works. In this work, I want to showcase the development of the Chinese epidemic and how people are living in a different world, and to reflect on what the epidemic has brought us through the stories of the epidemic.
